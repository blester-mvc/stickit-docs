    - Only tabular style reports will be available in the default report list and when searching. Summary and joined reports are not supported.
    - Reports **MUST** include the `Salesforce Record Id` as the **first** column of the report. The Record Id should identify the record for which the label will be generated.
    - As is standard when running reports in the standard Salesforce Report interface, only the first 2000 result rows will be available.
