title: Important Notes for New 5 Series Printers (550, 550 Turbo, 5XL)
authors: blester

- ~~5 series printers are not yet supported for web printing on MacOS until DYMO releases an update to the Connect software.~~
- 5 series printers require the DYMO Connect software.
 - Please uninstall all other versions of the DYMO Software and reboot prior to installing DYMO Connect. Web printing will not work if DLS v8 and DYMO Connect are both installed. 
- 5 series printers will only print on DYMO brand labels. Third-party "compatible" labels will not work in 5 series printers. To continue using third-party labels, please use the 4 series printers (450, 450 Turbo, 450 Twin Turbo, 4XL) instead.
